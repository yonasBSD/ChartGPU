# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Shared GPUDevice support** - Multiple `ChartGPU` instances can share a single, pre-initialized `GPUDevice` (via injected `adapter` + `device`) to reduce redundant initialization and improve dashboard ergonomics.
- **`deviceLost` event (shared device mode)** - When using an injected/shared device, charts emit a `deviceLost` event so apps can recreate chart instances without ChartGPU destroying the shared device.
- **Acceptance: auto-scroll + zoom sync** - Added an acceptance example that covers auto-scroll behavior with zoom synchronization.
- **GPUContext shared-device tests** - Added tests covering injection/ownership semantics, conditional device destruction behavior, and validation in shared device mode.

### Changed
- **Chart creation context injection** - `ChartGPU.create(...)` supports injecting a device/adapter context for shared device mode while preserving existing initialization behavior.
- **Zoom range change events** - Enhanced zoom range change event behavior (see `feat: add auto-scroll zoom sync and enhance zoom range change events`).

- **Animation interruption during legend toggle** - Avoided interrupting in-progress animations on visibility-only changes.
- **Legend toggle render delay** - Ensured an initial render occurs when starting update animations so legend toggles apply immediately.

### Fixed
- **Grouped bar layout** - Fixed grouped/clustered bar rendering so bars stay clipped and don’t overlap within a category.
