# Delegate clarifying questions (CRITICAL)

When you need clarification during planning or execution:

- **Do NOT ask the user by default** and do not wait for user input.
- **Delegate the question(s) to the appropriate subagent(s)** instead.
- **Accept the subagent answer(s)**, choose the most reasonable assumptions, and proceed.
- **Only ask the user** if the question is truly blocking and cannot be answered by any subagent or the repo/context.

## Multiple questions

- Delegate in **parallel** when possible (multiple subagents).
- Then **summarize the answers** and continue with a concrete next step.
